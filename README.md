Visualization is an efficient way of learning any concept faster than 
conventional methods. Modern technology allows creating e-Learning 
tools that also helps in improving computer science education very 
much. The goal of this project is to create a web based e-Learning tool, 
‘Pathfinding Visualizer’, which can be used to visualize shortest path 
algorithms. The conceptual application of the project is illustrated by 
implementation of algorithms like Dijkstra’s , A*,BFS and DFS. This 
project aims to complete all these tasks with some knowledge of HTML, 
CSS, JavaScript and React Framework. The end product is a web 
application so that any user can easily see and learn the working of the 
algorithms. User-friendliness of the project provides user with easy 
instructions on how to operate it. The initial results of using the 
application show promises of the benefits of this e-Learning tool 
towards students getting a good understanding of shortest paths 
algorithms.
➢ A visual pathfinding program that allows the user to create their own 
obstacles or mazes and then run different pathfinding algorithm on it.
➢ Pathfinding algorithm used to find optimal path between source and 
destination node.
➢ Pathfinding is a common programming challenge with a wide range of 
uses. We know it mainly from navigation and games. However, once you 
know the core algorithms, you'll find that they apply to more abstract 
optimization and sequencing problems.
➢ In this project we will be building a pathfinding algorithm visualizer.
➢ It will support B.F.S. , D.F.S. , A* , Dijkstra’s Algorithm.



The Systems program emphasizes the use of computers as sophisticated 
problem solving tools.
Path finding algorithms build on top of graph search algorithms and 
explore routes between nodes, starting at one node and traversing 
through relationships until the destination has been reached. These 
algorithms find the cheapest path in terms of the number of hops or 
weight. Weights can be anything measured, such as time, distance, 
capacity, or cost.
The purpose of the system is to create a convenient and easy-to-use 
system for users. We hope to provide a comfortable User experience 
along with the best resources. 
The software is web-based application and can be hosted on the 
internet. 
 It also provides a clean and user friendly Interface to the users.
