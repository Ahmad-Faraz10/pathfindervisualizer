# pathfindervisualizer
Path finding algorithms build on top of graph search algorithms and  explore routes between nodes, starting at one node and traversing  through relationships until the destination has been reached. These  algorithms find the cheapest path in terms of the number of hops or  weight. Weights can be anything measured, such as time, distance
